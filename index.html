      <img class="img" src="assets/images/profile.png" alt="Helen Pastras image">

      <p>My name is Helen Pastras and I am a Software Product Manager and as of recently a Full Stack Web Developer, amongst my many things! I come from a Hospitality software background; I’ve been a Product manager for 7 years and worked for a SaaS Property management startup in NY and then for one of the original forces in the industry responsible for allowing your first online hotel reservations to take place.</p>

      <p>I was always fascinated with the techy side of things, but never involved enough, until I got in! I was actually on the very opposite side, of being very "un-techy" yet I have grown to build complete applications from inception and design, to architecture, databases, logic and front end! I have a passion for non-profits that help the environment and the ones in need and my private development projects are focused around that.</p>

      <p>I’m originally from Greece, where I studied hospitality management, then became a New Yorker for several years before realizing how much I missed the sun and good fortune brought me in Southern California. My husband Michael and I make chocolates from scratch (Bean to Bar) which takes a lot of time but makes everything smell great!</p>

      <p>(Nerdy trivia: I’m a huge Harry Potter fan, but no, I don’t play Quiddich!)</p>
